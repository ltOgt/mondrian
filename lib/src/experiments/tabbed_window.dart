Maybe really go for the single tree approach in combination with the public/private keys

Could either first implement the public/private for duplicate leafs in master, and then use that here.
Or implement it here and later use it for duplicate leafs in master.

Sketch of desirable API:

tree: MondrianTree(
  root: MondrianBranch(
    fraction: 1,              TODO would be good idea to have an assertion in tree that the root is always fraction 1
    children: [
      // regual branches and leafs
      <...>,
      MondrianTabContainer(   TODO this is basically the same as a leaf, and will internally represented as such, but does not need to subclass the leaf (mapped to _LeafInternal)
        fraction: <fraction>,
        activeTabIndex: 0,
        // NO PUBLIC ID, only internal one (just like branches)
        tabs: [
          MondrianTab(        TODO this will still get a leaf id (public and internal), but will not be mapped to a _LeafInternal while in the tab group
            id: <public_leaf_id>,
            // NO FRACTION
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],

  ),
),

Might need to implement it as a custom Node type after all...
<- When moving a tab out of the tab group, the adding part is not a problem, but the removal part would cause issues if the core does not know about tabs

But maybe in combination with the private / internal tree it still works out to have the internal tab group be an extension of the child
  Move insertion of the tab group, as well as of a single tab would work as is, all assumptions should still hold
  Only need to add the center case, which is already sketched out and not too hard to implement

  Move removal just needs an aditional outer case that checks if the source is a tab
    if still children left => just remove child and change active index
    other wise change the tab to a leaf

The internal / public IDs + trees are still needed for duplicate leafs anyways, so we can get away with no id for a tab container in the tree the user sees


The problem with two seperate trees is that if we return the altered public tree to the user, we will always need to rebuild the private tree on each setState

maybe instead, we just add an internal CircleId to MondrianTab that is not exposed to the user.
this would not be serialized, and there is no need for it to be stable across two different move processes.
ยง {
  class MondrianTab extends WindowManagerLeaf {
    final int activeTabIndex;
    final List<WindowManagerLeafId> tabs;

    MondrianTab._({
      required WindowManagerLeafId id,
      required double fraction,
      required this.tabs,
      required this.activeTabIndex,
    }) : super(id: id, fraction: fraction);

    static final CircleIdGen _idGen = CircleIdGen();

    factory MondrianTab({
      required double fraction,
      required List<WindowManagerTabLeafId> tabs,
      required int activeTabIndex,
    }) =>
        MondrianTab._(
          id: WindowManagerTabLeafId(_idGen.next.value),
          fraction: fraction,
          tabs: tabs,
          activeTabIndex: activeTabIndex,
        );

    @override
    WindowManagerNodeAbst updateFraction(double newFraction) {
      return MondrianTab._(
        id: id,
        fraction: newFraction,
        tabs: tabs,
        activeTabIndex: activeTabIndex,
      );
    }
  }
}

This way we dont need a public/private tree for the tab group at least.
in the resolve call we can also still switch over the id subtype.
moving the entire tab should now be free as well (since its just a leaf)

moving a tab out still requires a special case for the removal
moving a tab in still requires a special case for the pos.center (dropping on the tab bar can also just trigger the same call with pos.center)


SHOULD also be able to use a secondary internal CircleId for the regular leafs to distinguish different instances
will need to check if a tab already has that leaf and simply remove the dropped one without adding it to the list if so
