class TabbedWindow {}

//TODO maybe good idea to have top level lookup of Map<LeafId, TreePath> that has to be updated on moves
// + quick resolve if needed (no search necessary)
// - need to keep consistent, and probably build once on start up (small negative though)
// + can quickly check for containment
// _ => before adding unchecked duplicates

//TODO what about duplicate IDs ...
// ! its perfectly legal to have multiple windows with the same file open...
// ? maybe can use above idea of top level lookup as workaround
// _ : have _
// _ _ e Map<LeafId-Public,List<LeafId-Internal>>
// _ _ _ ยง "MyLeaf" => ["MyLeaf-<timestamp1>", "MyLeaf-<timestamp-2>"]
// _ _ _ : one unique ID to represent the object, one unique id each to represent the window
// _ _ e Map<LeafId-Internal, TreePath>
// _ _ _ : unique mapping to a single path
// _ _ _ ! THIS WOULD NEED TO BE UPDATED
// _ _ e Map<LeafId-Internal, LeafId-Public>
// _ _ _ : resolve back from internal to public to get the actual widget representing the object
// ** skipping this for now while implementing tabs, will come back to this after that


// Decided to not implement tabs in the core of mondrian, but instead use a normal leaf and bolt tabs into it
// this keeps the complexity in the core of the movement stuff simpler
//
// the main idea is that a tab has a leaf id that is not given to the user to be resolved,
// while the tab leaf holds a list of further leafs that are not placed directly inside the tree, but are given to the user to resolve them to widgets
//
// . tried tabs as special state of branch or special state of leaf before, but that resulted in problems
// _ -- special branch
// _ _ S could have branches inside tabs (might be cool, but also unecessary and confusing)
// _ _ S would need ability to move next to group (alternative is the above "move into tab and create branch in tab")
// _ _ S would need ability to move entire group (might be cool, but out of scope for now, since complicates: breaks many assumptions inside the move code)
// _ _ S ...
// _ -- special leaf
// _ _ S had a few reasons, but forgot most of them now, point is, would also make things more complicated
